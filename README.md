WordPress Migration and Installation Script

This is a simple, single file PHP script that you can upload to the root of your web host (or WordPress install), load in a broswer and perform a variety of function to backup your database and site files along with restoring them to another host where the file has also been uploaded.

WARNING: This script has been for my personal use and does many dangerous things, it also poses a serious security issue if someone esle were to access it in the time it was on your server.
